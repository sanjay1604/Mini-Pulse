# Mini-Pulse
## IDEA: Custom surveys created by user. These surveys can be responded by audience and results will be reported.

## SURVEY TEMPLATE 
the survey will have three different question types: 

1.  Textbox
2.  Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
3.  Checkbox

## DETAILS 
The code will be written in Java. The idea is to create a custom survey so the audience response will be reported only with a built http server(RESTful recommended). The database will be MYSQL but will be accessed through JDBC.

The interface would be in such a way that when a user logins, a list of owned poll will be rendered. Additionally, they can also respond to public ACCEPTING polls. Users can create polls, add questions and view poll reports. They can also respond to polls created by other Users and submit them.
